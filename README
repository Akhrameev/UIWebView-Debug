UIWebView+Debug
======

UIWebView+Debug adds simple script debugging capabilities to Apple's UIWebView.

Usage:

Simply add the two files to your Project.
#import "WebView+Debug.h"

Next adapt the header file to enable or disable parser call backs.

Make sure to not include this in your release build of the application as it uses private Frameworks.

The DEBUG defines should sort this out for you. If this code is left in, Apple will the application.


Credits
======
This little UIWebView Category was inspired by this Stack Overflow post:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/193119/

Credits go to Robert Sanders and Kresimir Prcela for giving the right clues.
I then decided to take these two posts and merge them into one easy to use drop-in category.

Cheers,

Pablo Guillen
